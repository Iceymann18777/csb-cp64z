# v0.11.1

This version of the testnet targets the v0.11.1 version of the spec. The contract is deployed
in the goerli testnet. (v0.11.1, but SECIO as the default handshake instead of NOISE)

The network can be viewed on [https://eth2stats.io](https://eth2stats.io) and validators activated through [`https://prylabs.net`](https://prylabs.net). This testnet targets the mainnet version of the spec with no custom changes.
